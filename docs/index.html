        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

        <p class="takeaways">
            Complete the <a href="#instructions">instructions below</a> to build your own modern application platform,
            a Heroku-like environment built on Kubernetes which will deploy your code from a Git repository to a
            production-grade Kubernetes cluster.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            This article was first introduced as a lecture at the University of Colorado in the Spring of 2021.
            The lecture was intended to give students a behind the scenes look at how a modern application platform
            works.

        <p>
            Given that developer productivity and operator efficiency continues to remain top of mind for both startup
            and enterprise companies alike, we thought that we would share the lecture as an article.
            The open source projects included in the article are all part of the <a href="https://www.cncf.io">Cloud
            Native Computing Foundation</a>.

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            Over the past few years, we have observed companies move away from multi-tenant platforms in favor of public
            cloud providers that host Kubernetes as a service.
            An obvious driver being freedom of choice around associated components contributing to their infrastructure.
            Another driver, public cloud providers all agreed on a single container orchestration engine - Kubernetes.
            In the telecommunications industry, we would call stand-alone Kubernetes <em>basic dial tone</em>.
            Just enough to establish basic phone service.
            And similar to voicemail and the ability to make emergency calls, cloud providers have improved upon basic
            dial tone - resulting in numerous tools and applications that are easy to integrate, intended to
            significantly increase developer productivity and operator efficiency.

        <p>
            We have also seen a trend toward maintaining a Kubernetes cluster per team or even per application,
            depending on the size of the application.
            The movement is possible largely because building a self-service platform has become increasingly easy
            over the past several years due to the explosion of open source within the platform engineering community.
            This is commonly referred to as DevOps or DevSecOps.

        <p>
            The steps below will walk you through building a modern application platform, recently referred to as a
            secure software supply chain.

        <h2>Project Structure</h2>

        <p>
            We’ll need a few things before deploying our application - mainly our dial tone or Kubernetes cluster and
            a few additional components to complete the infrastructure.

        <p>
            The <a href="https://github.com/continuumcollective/freshcloud">GitHub repository</a> contains a <a
            href="https://github.com/continuumcollective/freshcloud/tree/main/bin">bin</a> directory with scripts that
            deploy and configure all the infrastructure components.
            We’ll also be using Google’s Cloud Platform (GCP).
            If you haven’t used GCP in the past <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">sign up for a free account</a>.

        <p>
            Below are the main components and the associated software that we will be using.

        <ul>
            <li>Kubernetes cluster: <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform</a></strong></li>
            <li>Ingress controller: <strong><a href="https://projectcontour.io">Contour</a></strong></li>
            <li>Certificate management: <strong><a href="https://cert-manager.io">Cert-Manager</a></strong></li>
            <li>Image registry and scanning: <strong><a href="https://goharbor.io">Harbor</a></strong></li>
            <li>Image building and buildpack support: <strong><a href="https://github.com/pivotal/kpack">KPack</a></strong></li>
            <li>Continuous integration and delivery pipeline: <strong><a href="https://concourse-ci.org">Concourse</a></strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Let’s get started.

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

        <p>
            Before we begin let's make sure we have the prerequisites in order.
            Feel free to skip any of these steps if you already have the prerequisite completed.

        <h3>Google Cloud</h3>

        <p>
            Make sure you have a
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account">billing account created</a>
            for your Google Cloud account.
            Install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install">Google Cloud SDK</a>then use the steps below
            to log in to Google Cloud and set up a project.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">gcloud auth login</code>
<code class="shell">gcloud projects create {your_project_name}</code>
<code class="shell">gcloud config set project {your_project_name}</code>
<code class="shell">gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com</code>
<code class="shell">gcloud alpha billing accounts list</code>
<code class="shell">gcloud alpha billing projects link {your_project_name} --billing-account 0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X</code>
<code class="shell">gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com</code>
        </pre>

        <h3>Local software</h3>

        <p>
            Install <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a>,
            <a href="https://helm.sh">the Helm CLI</a>,<a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker</a>,
            and <a href="https://github.com/mikefarah/yq">yq</a> to your local machine.
            Make sure that Docker is running before you start the exercises.

        <p>
            Finally, clone the repository to get the scripts we'll need to create our modern application
            platform.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">git clone git@github.com:continuumcollective/freshcloud.git</code>
        </pre>

        <h2>Platform configuration</h2>

        <p>
            First we’ll need a few configuration settings for our platform environment.
            The scripts in this project use values from <em>.env_development.sh</em> file in the project root directory.
            Let's fill that out first.

        <p>
            Create and then edit <em>.env_development.sh</em> and enter the below values.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">touch .env_development.sh</code>
<code class="shell">vi .env_development.sh</code>
        <code># Deployment defaults
export DOMAIN='yourdomain.com'		    # Enter the DNS subdomain
export EMAIL_ADDRESS='nobody@gmail.com'     # E-Mail for CERT registration confirmation
export PASSWD='my-pass'                     # Password that will be used throughout the project

# GCP cluster info
export GCP_PROJECT_NAME='your-gcp-project'  # GCP project name
export K8S_CLUSTER_NAME='cluster-name'      # Cluster name
export REGION='us-central1'                 # GCP region
export ZONE='us-central1-c'                 # Availability zone</code>
    </pre>

        <h2>Kubernetes cluster</h2>

        <p>
            Kubernetes has become the de facto container orchestration engine for deploying and managing distributed
            systems.
            Most public cloud providers now include support for running Kubernetes clusters.
            And as mentioned above, we’ll be using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for our Kubernetes cluster.

        <p>
            Create a Kubernetes cluster by running the script below from the <em>bin</em> directory.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">bash 00-create-cluster.sh gcp</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Upon success you will see the below output.

        <pre><code>
NAME                    NUM_NODES  STATUS
{your_cluster_name}     5          RUNNING
    </code></pre>


        <h2>Ingress controller</h2>

        <p>
            By default when an application or service is deployed to Kubernetes the application is only accessible
            inside the cluster and is only able to interact with other internal services.
            This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-west_traffic">east-west traffic</a>.

        <p>
            Our IaaS has created a load-balancer to make our application available outside the cluster.
            The load-balancer will front traffic to <a href="https://projectcontour.io">Contour</a>, our
            <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">ingress controller</a>, allowing
            us to expose our service or application externally.
            This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-south_traffic">north-south traffic</a>.

        <p>
            Once deployed, Contour will programmatically update <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io">Envoy proxies</a> to
            control application routing based on annotations in our deployment manifests.
            We'll configure a wild-card DNS entry for our (sub)domain to point to the load-balancer.
            This will allow for dynamic application deployments.

        <p>
            From the <em>bin</em> directory, run the below install script for Contour.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">bash 01-install-contour.sh</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Upon success, the script will output the hostname and public IP address of our load-balancer which we’ll use
            to access all our external services.

        <pre><code>
Waiting to get the load-balancer IP.
Create a DNS for *.yourdomain.com to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    </code></pre>

        <p>
            Next set a wild-card DNS record to point to your load-balancer's IP address by creating an A record entry
            with your DNS provider.
            We use DNS Made Easy for managing our DNS records.
            Use the following command to make sure your DNS is configured correctly before proceeding.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">nslookup xxx.yourdomain.com</code>
        </pre>

        <h2>Certificate management</h2>

        <p>
            Our basic dial tone does not have support for managing SSL certificates, so we’ll need a new component to
            manage the lifecycle of SSL certificates for our cluster.
            We’ll also need to choose a Certificate Authority (CA) to issue certificates.

        <p>
            For our use case, we’ll configure <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a>, our certificate
            management software, to use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, our certificate authority
            of choice.

        <p>
            To accomplish this, we’ll give cert-manager a secret destination.
            Cert Manager will then request a cert from Let's Encrypt.
            Let's Encrypt will provide us with short lived SSL certs that will be consumed by the Ingress controller and
            stored as Kubernetes secrets.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">bash 02-install-cert-manager.sh</code>
        </pre>

        <p>Upon success, you will see the below output.

        <pre><code>
All pods are running.
clusterissuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-staging created
clusterissuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-prod created
    </code></pre>

        <p>
            One of the benefits of using cert-manager is that cert-manager will automatically replace each SSL
            certificate before the certificate expires.

        <h2>Image registry</h2>

        <p>
            We’ll use <a href="https://goharbor.io">Harbor</a> for our
            <a href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/introduction/">image registry</a>.
            We’ll also use <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> to create the images which we’ll upload to our
            registry.
            Harbor will scan each of the Docker images we build for security vulnerabilities, issues, and errors.

        <p>
            Harbor will create two projects for each of the corresponding images below.

        <ul>
            <li>concourse-images (public) - images used by the pipeline.</li>
            <li>kpack (public) - image(s) used to build the application image and the application image, once created.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Run our next script from the <em>bin</em> directory to create the registry.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">bash 03-install-harbor.sh</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Upon success, you will see the output below.

        <pre><code>
All pods are running.
Sleeping while Harbor auth is set up.
Creating: concourse-images in Harbor.
Creating: kpack in Harbor.
url: https://registry.yourdomain.com
username: admin
password: {PASSWORD}
    </code></pre>

        <p>
            Navigate to the provided URL and log in to Harbor using the provided credentials.

        <h2>Continuous integration and delivery</h2>

        <p>
            We’ll be using a popular tool named <a href="https://concourse-ci.org">Concourse</a> for continuous delivery.
            Run our next script from the <em>bin</em> directory to install Concourse in our cluster.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">bash 04-install-concourse.sh</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Navigate to the provided URL and log in to Concourse using <em>admin</em> as the username and the password
            that you configured in your environment file.
        </p>

        <img src="images/early-concourse.png" alt="harbor">

        <h2>Build service</h2>

        <p>
            We’re almost done with all the components for our modern application platform.
            One last component: <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/kpack">kpack</a>, which gives us an implementation
            of a <a href="https://buildpacks.io">Cloud Native Buildpack</a>.
            Installing kpack in our cluster will create the builder objects used by Kubernetes to create application
            containers.

        <p>
            First install the <em>kpack-cli</em> binary on your local machine.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">wget https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli/releases/download/v0.2.0/kp-darwin-0.2.0 -O /usr/local/bin/kp</code>
<code class="shell">chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/kp</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Next deploy the kpack build service.
            This step will take slightly longer than previous steps as we’ll be building the images locally with Docker.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">bash 05-install-kpack.sh</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Upon success, you will see the below output.

        <pre><code>
All pods are running.
clusterstack.kpack.io/base created
clusterstore.kpack.io/default created
    </code></pre>

        <p>
            Harbor should now look similar to the image below.
        </p>

        <img src="images/harbor.png" alt="harbor">

        <p>
            We’ve now configured each of the components that contribute to our pipeline.
            Let’s deploy our application!

        <h2>Application deployment</h2>

        <p>
            Let’s deploy our application.
            We created a light-weight command line interface (CLI) called <em>freshctl</em> to manage your applications.

        <p>
            Run <em>freshctl</em> from the <em>bin</em> directory to test the CLI.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">./freshctl endpoints</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            The freshctl CLI takes a file or an application configuration as an argument.
            You'll see an example application called <em>kotlin-ktor-starter</em> in the <em>apps</em> directory.
            There are only three variables needed to configure our application.

        <ul>
            <li>The application name</li>
            <li>The application's GitHub repository</li>
            <li>The branch to deploy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Download the Concourse <em>fly</em> CLI tool from our Concourse installation, substituting your Concourse
            URL for the URL below.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">wget ‘https://ci.yourdomain.com/api/v1/cli?arch=amd64&platform=darwin’ -O /usr/local/bin/fly</code>
<code class="shell">chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/fly</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Let’s review the steps the freshclt CLI performs to deploy our application.

        <ul>
            <li>Create the application namespace
            <li>Create the builder object in the namespace</li>
            <li>Write the pipeline and params yaml</li>
            <li>Install the pipeline to Concourse</li>
            <li>Start a build</li>
            <li>Upload the application image to Harbor</li>
            <li>Create an application deployment:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create TLS Certificate</li>
                    <li>Create k8s Service</li>
                    <li>Create k8s Ingress</li>
                    <li>Deploy application container</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            OK, let’s deploy the kotlin-ktor-starter app with freshctl's <em>add</em> command.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">./freshctl add apps/kotlin-ktor-starter.app</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            View the build logs by running the below command.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">kp build logs kotlin-ktor-starter-image -n kotlin-ktor-starter</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Upon success, run the below command and see the application URL.

        <pre>
<code class="shell">./freshctl apps</code>

<code>kotlin-ktor-starter        kotlin-ktor-starter.yourdomain.com</code>
        </pre>
